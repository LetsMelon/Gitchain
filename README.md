# Gitchain

> Warning: This is the first version (beta, really beta). There are no tests, a good ui or a documentation!

This is a terminal application to change between config profils for git.

## Example

You have two email addresses. Your first email addresses `test@privat.com` is your privat one and `test@work.com` is your email for your work.
With Gitchain you can easily switch between them without typing the values everytime.

## How to use it?

Download the application with npm

```sh
npm install --global gitchain
```

start the program with `gitchain`, it should create a json file with an array called `profiles`. Look into `config.example.json` how a profile should look like.

## TODO

- tests!
- documentation
- better ui (see #2)
